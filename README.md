# AnimatedSettingsView

Having seen an animation of this function years ago, I now want to share the AnimatedSettingsView implementation with you.

## Project

Includes an ExampleProject in Swift 3 which is a SingleViewController-Application with two equal Sized Views. Both Views have two Labels, an ImageView for displaying an icon and an UISwitch Object. The Views are configured by calling `setup(withBackgroundColor color:UIColor)`. Using the delegatefunction `valueChanged()` of the UISwitch Objects the background is filled.
